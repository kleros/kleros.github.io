However, as a way to incentivize price formation, the Interactive Coin Offering rewards participants who make their contribution early in the sale. Buyers who purchase tokens early will receive a 20% bonus. The bonus decreases smoothly down to 10% at the beginning of the withdrawal lock, and then goes to 0% by the end of the crowdsale.",
